NYT Crossword Downloader
========================

Before you begin, you need to retrieve your nytimes.com cookies and save them in this folder. I recommend using the Chrome extension "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" for this purpose.

To run this program, open a command prompt and use the "cd" command to switch to this folder:

  cd <path>

where <path> is replaced by the path to this folder (e.g. "~/Downloads" or "C:\Users\jdoe\Downlaods").

Run in Windows:

  nyt-crossword-downloader

Run in macOS:

  ./nyt-crossword-downloader
